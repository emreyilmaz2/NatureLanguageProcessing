new device us carbon nanotube catch tumor cell quickly
could eventually allow doctor see cancer spread original site faster ever harvard mit researcher developed tool capable identifying single cancer cell within blood sample
mehmet toner study leader professor biomedical engineering harvard medical school brian wardle mit associate professor aeronautics astronautics created instrument could eventually allow doctor see cancer spread original site faster ever
circulating tumor cell cancer cell escaped original tumor difficult find sample blood ten billion normal blood cell contains several circulating tumor cell
death cancer percent result cancer primary site said wardle
tumor spread original site
response dilemma toner created new microfluidic device capable detecting circulating tumor cell
originally designed device four year ago worked allowing patient blood sample travel past ten thousand little silicon post covered antibody
antibody stick tumor cell cancer cell touch silicon post caught held place
problem prototype certain cell might never come contact silicon post
toner since made change device help wardle making eight time better original
microfluidic device feature porous post instead solid made using carbon nanotube
carbon nanotube small hollow cylinder wall made carbon atom lattice
forest nanotube billion billion carbon nanotube per square centimeter percent air le percent carbon
much like original version carbon nanotube coated antibody capture particular cancer cell
device also customizable allowing researcher attach different antibody carbon nanotube adjusting space nanotube order catch object different size circulating tumor cell virus
porous post allow cell run much like filter offering greater chance catching cell researcher looking
toner wardle device currently tested hospital expected made available commercially within next year
addition researcher hope adjust device hiv diagnosis well
study published small
