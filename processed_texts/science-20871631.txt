south pole first building blown year
select ever make south pole
still fewer get blow thing
one man distinction blowing piece real estate south pole called home
little sad day go said john rand consulting engineer army cold region research engineering laboratory crrel
last december antarctic sun recently reported rand part crew charged dynamiting piece history first permanent dwelling ever built south pole
related extreme living scientist end earth
decade since constructed mid outpost swallowed snow frozen continent
frightening accident original south pole station go
rand specialist drilling ice core long cylinder ice pulled glacier passed first south pole stay station exercise long hour isolation bachelor living late early
even station foot meter surface
chamber called top hat giant box roughly dimension station identical building stacked atop structure keep roof snow tends compact thus sink building snow blow pile around
essence terrain rising said george blaisdell operation manager national science foundation antarctic program explained physic work south pole make building difficult
elevation south pole changed last year blaisdell told ouramazingplanet put something surface came back year later would snowpack
precisely happened old south pole station
time rand helped blow station december foot meter surface
however station played pivotal role scientific world history
first never original station military affair essentially series glorified box made sturdy wooden beam plywood
research base built seabees navy construction unit building structure began late station dedicated january
project stemmed international geophysical year igy period coordinated scientific endeavor july december country including united state soviet union several european nation sent thousand researcher wild region planet push boundary earth science
american christened base igy south pole station honor human ever set foot pole ahead seminal construction
people first last pole nearly five decade earlier famed race pitted norwegian explorer roald amundsen doomed englishman robert falcon scott
amundsen race scott died return journey pole
related image race south pole
conclusion igy time came pack go home american decided stay put little station degree south latitude
great science happening south pole permanent station literal convergence planet longitude line enormous strategic value
felt geographic south pole would something claim blaisdell said longer anyone else able put pressure people trying divvy antarctica
american extended stay antarctica pole one several geopolitical circumstance paved way antarctic treaty signed world first nuclear arm agreement milestone international decision leave frozen continent free territorial claim country
treaty still force today
danger zone original station largely abandoned newer station nearby constructed dome
station turn recently abandoned brand new facility dedicated gleaming construction perched atop stilt ratcheted higher snow begin encroach
rand said original station invisible beneath snow marked surface flag covered area foot meter
prepare demolish station rand colleague drilled warren hole topmost level buried station threaded dynamite snow
course three day early december charge detonated collapsing roof station creating large crater snow
rand said mixed emotion watched explosion shoot snow high air
truly end station
year intact put bed rand said
however said done
area dangerous
year earlier despite visible network flag marking perimeter site giant tractor somehow ended atop former station
snow collapsed beneath weight massive machine crashed top roof old station
driver hurt ended bottom hole
quickly retrieved crew harness getting tractor proved tricky
accident call according blaisdell rand wheel put motion remove danger
video link http year friend almost got hurt badly needed solve problem rand said

giant crater remains station stood already begun fill snow blaisdell said area would safe new construction soon perhaps early
high altitude dry condition extreme vantage point south pole offer best observing condition earth newly real estate highly coveted among scientist brimming idea
matter deciding one best possible payoff blaisdell said
