undersea volcano ooze also explode
study find high level carbon dioxide confirms scientist say volcano explode instead oozing scientist confirm
new proof level carbon dioxide magma volcano coast oregon suggests volcano may play greater role global climate thought
volcanic activity earth percent percent take place ridge middle ocean
volcano apparently spew huge volume lava instead erupting explosively many volcano land
high level gas trapped volcano magma normally fuel explosive volcanic burst
level long thought low ridge moreover potential undersea explosion would suppressed crushing pressure surrounding water
however based volcanic ash found certain site geologist speculated last decade explosive eruption take place volcano
researcher say proof
