mar connection
jeffrey marlow graduate student california institute technology writes new mexico measuring sand particle size layer thickness angle address question volcano rock pattern mar
saturday march base surge deposit kilbourne hole hunt hole part much larger story story start desolate plain mar
mar exploration rover opportunity started surveying outpost found several tantalizing feature pointed history
crossbedding salt mineral seemed precipitate evaporating lake famed blueberry accretionary spherule formed movement water local rock
science exhausting every opportunity prove theory wrong accepting caveat probability likelihood
many devil advocate pointed base surge deposit citing crossbedding lapilli sphere viable alternative suggesting sedimentary environment mar volcanic
lauren edgar doctoral student leading expedition also work mission recall lot debate origin sediment deposited damp wet subaqueous condition part volcanic base surge deposit like one observing kilbourne hole hunt hole
jeffrey marlow volcanic rock north border lunar training ground distinguishing possibility tested rover scientific arsenal
earth usually lot context easier make distinction say lauren
mar dealing small snapshot deposit lot harder
despite cosmetic similarity rover team consensus moment water required produce sedimentary feature opportunity encountered
nonetheless pretty likely base surge deposit volcanic abundant mar
john grotzinger advising lauren work maar deposit project scientist coming mar science laboratory mission
early history mar characterized enormous number bolide impact struck surface mar sending plume debris high atmosphere note
plume settled back surface created base surge deposit
thus establishing set criterion help distinguish base surge sediment deposit critical step reconstructing ancient martian environment
john put important able distinguish two since subaqueous condition strong potential habitable environment
one potentially useful marker noticed new mexico distribution lapilli ashy hailstone fall cloud volcanic debris
blueberry concretion mar distributed throughout rock spherule occur certain layer reflecting periodic discrete nature volcanic hailstorm
initial result also suggest sudden change grain size rock layer specific angle sedimentary signature may additional criterion help diagnose base surge deposit
sun set final evening periodic dust devil swirl desert plain south look crater find easy imagine mar
cue red filter cut vegetation dial thermostat back bit would hard pressed tell two world apart
course difference red blue planet significant continued sedimentological study mar analogue like hunt hole kilbourne hole able paint complete picture mar like past
fieldwork much real work come back lab sample processed photograph analyzed clear base surge deposit produce unique depositional feature hopefully resolvable current future mar mission
sample stowed healthy sheen desert dust covering u head back el paso leaving crater coyote
