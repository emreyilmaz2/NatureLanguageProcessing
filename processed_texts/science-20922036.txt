geoid map earth gravity yield planet
video april fool joke earth really shaped like potato
however shape see um slightly exaggerated highlight irregularity
another caveat depicted shape planet rather shape idealized surface extending around entire globe surface earth scientist call geoid
video accurate reconstruction geoid date released european space agency scientific meeting munich march see video related press conference
based data collected esa gravity field ocean circulation explorer goce
long probe low orbit almost exactly two year collecting painstakingly accurate measurement gravitational field earth
ala many web site blog reported goce result far got wrong
contrary stated report geoid surface strength gravity every point
geoid word oceanographer goce team surface placed marble anywhere would stay rather rolling direction
another way saying imagine engineer traveling around world level
wherever go level would exactly parallel geoid place
yet another equivalent definition surface everywhere perpendicular direction word gravitational field
gravity need strength everywhere geoid
word could walk geoid would see gravity always pointing exactly downwards weight could slightly change one region another
misunderstanding may stemmed confusion two concept multivariable calculus vector field potential
vector field case gravity field potential gravitational potential essentially gravitational energy unit mass
point space gravity field seen direction gravitational potential rise fastest
magnitude length rate change potential
field defined way called gradient vector field potential
general gradient quantity defined space version derivative quantity sense calculus
pedantic historical reason gravity field defined opposite vector gradient potential
follow gravitational field line curve every point tangent vector field point would follow curve steepest ascent gravitational potential
called gradient
note inertia field line gravitational field necessarily trajectory body free fall
field wo tell direction moving direction accelerate
gradient vector field difficult grasp picturing potential visualize ascent descent would require fourth dimension
analogy might help
think water trickle hilly surface
neglecting inertia droplet water would follow curve steepest descent vector field made vector along surface
analogy elevation droplet analogue potential point
analogue geoid elevation contour topographical map potential height constant along contour
obviously part contour steep terrain whereas others mild gradient
topographical map slope steeper many different contour line crowded together
magnitude gradient vector field represents steepness slope point contour
thus gravity change strength along geoid geoid shape gravity matter stood one blogger put
earth would look like shape distorted make gravity everywhere surface reported major news site went add area strongest gravity yellow weakest blue apparently noticing contradiction previous sentence
many reason geoid sphere
first foremost earth sphere
closer ellipsoid flattened pole centrifugal force rotation
planet ellipsoid either topography
mountain valley asymmetrical distribution mass
mass distribution affect gravitational field make geoid asymmetrical
earth inner outer structure
oceanic crust landmass continental shelf made different material different density farther mantle uniform either region slightly different composition temperature thus slightly different density
variation reiner rummel senior goce scientist told email reflect process deep earth mantle descending tectonic plate hot mantle plume
affect strength gravitational field goce orbit
probe measure effect thus measure gravitational field
geoid confused anomaly due topography land although affected part
also thing get really tricky confused actual sea level
wait minute say ocean supposed sea level definition
except relatively small perturbation wave tide say surface exactly horizontal perpendicular gravitational field everywhere
sea level mean
yes approximation
however ocean homogenous
difference salinity temperature make le dense
moreover earth rotation produce force keep ocean constant motion
like water river level flow sea reason water ocean also difference height
height clear mean elevation relative geoid positive negative
oceanographer thus speak topography ocean meaning really hill valley
fact ocean circulation part goce name come play one main goal mission measure ocean topography deduce structure oceanic current
deviation geoid simplified ellipsoidal model earth substantial range meter dark blue video meter yellow rummel say
surface video geoid amplified factor say goce mission manager rune floberghagen
