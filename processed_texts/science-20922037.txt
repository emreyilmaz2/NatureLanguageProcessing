amazing disappearing neutrino
eugenie samuel reich nature magazine neutrino long perplexed physicist uncanny ability evade detection many ghostly particle apparently going missing en route sun earth
refined version old calculation causing stir suggesting researcher also systematically underestimated number particle antimatter partner antineutrino produced nuclear reactor experiment
deficit could caused antineutrino turning sterile antineutrino ca directly detected would clear evidence effect beyond standard model particle physic
physicist ray davis working deep underground homestake gold mine south dakota found flux solar neutrino hitting earth third predicted calculation nuclear reaction sun theorist john bahcall
davis later received nobel prize contribution neutrino astrophysics
puzzle considered solved sudbury neutrino observatory sno canada found missing alternative mean detection
sno result taken evidence neutrino mass allows oscillate three flavor electron muon tau
davis detected electron neutrino
experiment measure rate antineutrino production decay uranium plutonium isotope far produced result roughly consistent theory
revised calculation accepted week physical review suggests whole story
waiting double chooz neutrino experiment france become fully operational thierry lasserre colleague french atomic energy commission cea saclay set check prediction rate antineutrino production nuclear reactor
repeated calculation first done klaus schreckenbach technical university munich using modern technique allowed much precise
new estimate rate production around previously predicted
mean several generation neutrino antineutrino experiment unknowingly missed small fraction particle
completely surprise u say lasserre
double chooz consists two detector measuring flux antineutrino produced chooz nuclear power plant french ardennes one detector meter away plant kilometer away
far detector became operational year
stefan schönert neutrino physicist technical university munich say calculation solid checked schreckenbach

art mcdonald queen university kingston canada sno say people look carefully calculation may systematic error
add doubt would significance physic result shown accuracy
result may pointing evidence neutrino antineutrino oscillating fourth kind neutrino antineutrino sterile version interact ordinary matter say carlo giunti physicist university turin italy
experiment previously seen evidence sterile particle including liquid scintillator neutrino detector los alamo national laboratory new mexico mini booster neutrino experiment miniboone fermilab batavia illinois search confirm existence hot area physic
giunti say magnitude anomaly uncovered lasserre statistically significant point promisingly direction another anomaly found sage collaboration studied neutrino radioactive source baksan neutrino observatory caucasus
used contradiction reactor radioactive source experiment agreement say giunti
