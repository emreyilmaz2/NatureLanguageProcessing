richard feynman thinker
heyday physicist richard feynman ensued death publishing entrepreneur might tempted start book club work
offered main selection would feynman autobiographical ramble told ralph leighton surely joking feynman
care people think
alternate selection reader could choose serious work like qed strange theory light matter spirited account counterintuitive behavior quantum world legendary feynman lecture physic
whatever man said swagger
would rather listen recording lecture feynman playing bongo
irresistible subject biographer called two subtitle curious character indeed
best biography james gleick genius captured ebullience sometimes winning sometimes exasperating gave lucid explanation hard physic
seeking mathematical treatment could turn jagdish mehra thick book beat different drum lighter touch christopher sykes ordinary genius illustrated richard feynman
hard imagine world need another feynman biography
quantum man richard feynman life science lawrence krauss director origin project arizona state university make way subject emerges enlightening addition field
krauss like feynman physicist well author written seven book including physic star trek
though could resist recycling feynman anecdote providing couple concentrate feynman thinker contribution merited fame
something easily summarized
einstein discovered relativity
murray discovered quark
feynman
well thing tv ice water showing challenger disintegrated
physicist famous something obscure cleaning mathematical mess known quantum electrodynamics ambitious attempt explain light matter using two great theory quantum mechanic special relativity
shared nobel prize two colleague julian schwinger tomonaga solved problem different way
feynman sum path approach expressed line squiggle became known feynman diagram opened intuitive understanding subatomic realm
krauss put beautiful pictorial way thinking quantum mechanic
good book give feel feynman later accomplishment
understood better watching shoulder krauss physicist worked way feynman oeuvre story fast time rio scientific paper
popular lore feynman often come wild man physic throwing one crazy idea another frenzied search truth
quantum man part great discovery series also written book see side master mathematician could concentrate problem hour recast surprising new manner
following chain idea led feynman nobel krauss begin familiar phenomenon way light ray take sudden bend enters pool water
angle calculated using staple high school physic called snell law century pierre de fermat provided deeper explanation light beam act though trying minimize total travel time
light move slowly water air adjusts course ensuring spends longer necessary denser medium
idea light beam thinking ahead universe somehow structured appears way
next century mathematician showed newton law motion could rewritten similar vein orbiting planet hurtling cannonball move though trying minimize abstract quantity called action
krauss give reader feel mean show feynman retooled idea solve nagging problem subatomic physic
one science great puzzle still partly solved reconcile regularity classical physic like bending light beam probabilistic law quantum mechanic
light consists photon capable kind strange thing
moving b photon may take number different path even one seem absurd spiraling curlicue changing speed midair
feynman method acrobatics added together weirdest one canceling one another yield motion observe familiar world
triumph came early career
later thinking physic example quantum cosmology original
maybe sometimes original krauss suggests
science usually proceeds building came
maverick feynman kept accepting even established idea torn apart reassembled piece
led deeper understanding time might better spent cutting edge
continued push physic forward modern scientist krauss writes tended lead rear best side flank
like quantum particle seemed eager try every path even crazy one
true life well physic
george johnson author eight book including strange beauty murray revolution physic
