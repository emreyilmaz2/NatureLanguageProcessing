toxin baby food might affect hormone study
new york infant formula solid baby food frequently contain hormone shown cause infertility mammal italian researcher report
scientist university pisa report many sample baby formula tested contaminated fungal hormone known mycoestrogens
tested formula sample sample baby food total brand commonly sold italy
substance detected baby product included zearalenone derivative come fusarium large family fungi common farm setting
although zearalenone related chemical resemble hormone estrogen linked infertility mammal especially pig clear whether baby exposed compound food formula would risk reproductive problem later life
previous research shown body rapidly break zearalenone byproduct pose health threat
still italian researcher say finding merit ought prompt closer scrutiny baby formula baby food presence toxin
study show presence mycoestrogens infant food francesco massart led study told reuters health
likely greater implication infant young child adult varied diet
mycoestrogens zearalenone fact life commercial agriculture
present crop like corn wheat soy used human consumption animal feed
cattle yard united state regularly use one substance growth stimulant animal although european union banned practice
italian group sought determine whether zearalenone similar chemical might making way infant food
answer proved yes
massart colleague analyzed sample brand infant formula containing cow milk
also tested sample baby food seven brand containing beef chicken turkey calf horse rabbit ham lamb
zearalenone appeared formula sample two derivative molecule alpha present quarter sample
among baby food alpha derivative present le quarter sample
concentration mycoestrogens varied widely general level detected well world health organization provisional maximum tolerable daily intake microgram per kilogram body weight
average concentration infant formula four time recommended maximum however
although massart acknowledged many question remain possible link mycoestrogens harm human said finding give pause parent use baby formula
child particular preterm newborn potentially exposed higher dose mycotoxin early phase life one know effect said
animal research available human study suggest early mycotoxin exposure may affect human health massart noted
specific study initiated allow establishment safe level zearalenone metabolite feed material compounded feed particularly infant child different age considered sensitive environmental chemical
gilbert ross physician medical director american council science health new advocacy group disagreed
detecting something food mean harmful ross said
detection method found contaminant level far low affect human health including baby
author point presence substance food product little significance body rapidly break excretes ross said
