favourite particle neutrino
started writing neutrino love
quite magical really universe completely swarming second abundant particle photon know practically nothing
know really weird
wrote favourite particle neutrino fit particle article
favourite particle
toyed favourite particle neutrino felt disrespectful
decided matter write top page
need post fall line others
suppose want symmetry
want warm feeling get starting read next book trilogy
neutrino postulated similar reason desire symmetry
hundred year ish ago lot great experimental science going
clear idea atom understanding solid ball
ernest rutherford others established experiment nucleus center atom postulated electron orbit around nucleus
came description based purely experimental result theory time predicted
feel quite nostalgic sort theory
era lhc done thing come new theory describe see experimentally
general result fit theory already proposed
tune theoretical prediction match data like twiddling load knob theory predictor call monte carlo twenty thirty knob get agreement
moaning really choice
anyway back good old day
something called beta decay observed
name knew
nice bit useful observational science
noticed atom would emit radiation without provocation
call radioactivity
active radiation
nothing radio radio also work via radiation
radio carried electromagnetic radiation first love photon
radiation loss energy something
energy invariably travel somewhere else form
thing radioactivity deliberate
happens naturally
first discovered triggered whole host scheme similar homeopathy suppose except homeopath make million plain water packaging whereas back day quack raking selling people radioactive
scientist rebelled lot people got cancer business end closed
laughed advert showed mate felt really sad thought people future okay present laughing friend buying proof hogswart
anyway science continued realized happening part atom fact part nucleus decaying
established radiation emitted electron measurement emitted particle charge mass exactly electron
electron thrown orbit emitted nucleus
interesting atomic nucleus contains proton charge neutron charge zero
get negatively charged particle thought neutron must decay proton electron zero charge
great
fitted nicely experimental measurement atom went beta decay
thing stopped comfortable
picture predicts precisely energy emitted radiation electron must
depending kind atom decay able predict exactly much energy electron measured energy carried emitted electron found electron could energy
huge problem conservation energy closest get feeling comfortable knowledge particle physic
always work
appeal fact theory beautiful elegant cold hard experiment
warm soft one
kind one
always get answer energy conserved
always
radioactivity
wolfgang pauli
must something else emitted something instrument detecting
pauli described property invisible particle must neutral charge small zero mass spin half like electron
new particle emitted along electron electron could energy total energy emitted could still add exact value predicted theory
new particle would ghost traveling matter without interacting
could explain detected
course comfortable place slightly le uncomfortable violating law conservation energy
pauli aware responsibility famously saying done terrible thing
postulated particle detected
wolfgang pauli knew stuff
okay make prediction test
science trying describe way world work understanding based observe theory testable
experimentalists laugh string theory
one happy ignore someone come way u test validity
okay reason ignore hard would much inclined make effort thought use
thankfully little neutral one neutrino detected
difficult
simply interact particle make matter
neutrino fly past atom
neutral affected electromagnetic field
thing nature anything weak nuclear force tend whizz universe planet u leaving trace
detect odd one
first year pauli prediction cowan reines
back saw whopping second thanks supernova going vicinity
generally bugger catch
know neutrino
almost nothing little bit know interesting indeed
standard model particle physic theory happy putting together little bit knowledge gathered thousand experiment hundred year tell u neutrino mass like photon
know case
neutrino mass
know three kind neutrino must different mass least two zero
feel like nobody really talk
perhaps hang wrong kind physicist
neutrino experiment shown standard model deeply flawed yet still persist calling standard model
finished writing without actually saying single thing love neutrino
mentioned able change flavour neutrino oscillation could antiparticle majorana dirac particle
help u understand dark matter fate universe hand
one thing completely deserving post written someone know onion able write something digression
