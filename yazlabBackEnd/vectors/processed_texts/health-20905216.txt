radioactive boar germany legacy chernobyl
radioactive boar quarter century chernobyl nuclear disaster soviet union carried cloud radiation across europe animal radioactive enough people urged eat
berlin look long radioactivity hang around consider germany wild boar
quarter century chernobyl nuclear disaster soviet union carried cloud radiation across europe animal radioactive enough people urged eat
mushroom pig dine fit consumption either
germany experience show could await japan problem fukushima plant get worse
nuclear power around world german boar roam forest nearly mile kilometer chernobyl
yet amount ofradioactive within tissue often register dozen time beyond recommended limit consumption thousand time normal
still feel consequence chernobyl fallout said christian kueppers radiation expert germany institute applied ecology freiburg
contamination wo go away time soon cesium roughly year theradioactivity slightly decrease coming year
cesium build body high level thought risk various cancer
still researcher studied chernobyl could find increase cancer might linked cesium
cesium also accumulates time soil make boar susceptible snuffle forest soil snout feed kind mushroom tend store radioactivity environment ministry spokesman thomas hagbeck said
problem common wild boar bagged hunter affected region checked radiation
government compensation hunter whose quarry destroyed added past month hagbeck said
really sad throw meat normally extraordinarily tasty said joachim reddemann managing director bavaria state hunting association
thousand wild boar killed southern germany every year register unacceptable level radiation
calculated becquerel measurement radiation given
anything beyond becquerel per kilogram recommended according germany federal office radiation protection
normal meat average contamination becquerel per kilogram german would normally consume becquerel per year plant dairy product agency said
percent boar hunted legal radioactivity limit reddemann said
government radiation protection office say mushroom registered time legal cesium limit
even farther away france still soil contamination though level dropped significantly
rare find unsafe level cesium boar mushroom said radiation expert philippe renaud france institute radiation protection nuclear safety
austria trace radioactive cesium remain soil
along boar mushroom deer affected testing five time legal limit country environment agency say
japan fukushima plant far leaked nearly much radiation chernobyl authority banned sale milk spinach cabbage product surrounding region precaution
european official insist occasionally eating contaminated boar meat mushroom pose immediate health risk
public health agency typically conservative setting limit radioactivity food
eating gram mushroom tested seven time legal cesium limit example would amount exposure altitude radiation taken flight according germany office radiation protection
austria authority say eating unlikely amount pound contaminated boar meat time legal cesium limit would amount adult normal annual radiation intake food
however possibility exposure going away anytime soon
assume wild game still similarly affected slowly recede said reddemann bavaria hunting association
problem certainly still around next year chernobyl still issue child grandchild
