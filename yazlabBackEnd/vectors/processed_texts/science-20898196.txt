ripple saturn jupiter ring caused comet crash
ripple saturn ring date back jupiter ring disrupted scientist traced ripple ring system saturn jupiter back collision comet ten year ago
ripple detected saturn ring date back disruption jupiter ring caused nasa researcher believe
culprit case jupiter comet whose debris cloud hurtled planet thin ring system kamikaze course planet july
scroll video saturn ripple caused similar object likely another cloud comet debris plunging inner ring second half
lead author dr matthew hedman cornell university new york said cool finding evidence planet ring affected specific traceable event happened last year rather hundred million year ago
solar system much dynamic place gave credit
nasa orbiter galileo visit jupiter scientist known since late patchy pattern jovian ring
galileo image fuzzy explain pattern would occur
trail cold cassini entered orbit around saturn started sending back thousand image
paper dr hedman colleague first noted corrugation saturn innermost ring dubbed ring
group including dr hedman dr mark showalter seti institute mountain view california realised groove ring appeared wind together tightly time
playing process backward dr hedman demonstrated pattern originated something tilted ring axis late
scientist found influence saturn gravity tilted area warped ring tightening spiral
cassini imaging scientist got another clue sun shone directly along saturn equator lit ring august
unique lighting condition highlighted ripple previously seen another part ring system
whatever happened small localised event big
collision tilted region mile wide covering part ring next outermost ring called c ring
unfortunately spacecraft visiting saturn time planet far side sun hidden telescope orbiting earth whatever happened passed unnoticed astronomer
dr hedman dr showalter began wonder whether pattern jupiter ring system might illuminate mystery
using galileo image dr showalter confirmed similar winding spiral pattern
applied math applied saturn jupiter gravitational influence factored
unwinding spiral pinpointed date jupiter ring tilted axis june september
plunged jovian atmosphere late july
estimated size nucleus also consistent amount material needed disturb jupiter ring
galileo image also revealed second spiral calculated originated
image taken new horizon spacecraft flew jupiter way pluto showed two newer ripple pattern addition fading echo impact
know collision ring common time per decade jupiter time per century saturn dr showalter said
scientist know ring record impact like groove vinyl record play back history later
ripple also give scientist clue size cloud cometary debris hit ring
case nucleus comet likely broke apart kilometre wide
finding detailed pair paper published online today journal science
