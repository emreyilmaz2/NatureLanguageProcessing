searching alien life
check failed star
potential exists planet dwarf researcher say search alien life usually focus planet around star
possibility life sprung planet somehow ejected original solar system became universe well small body called dwarf star small dim really star function like planet
study show body could potentially host atmosphere surface form extraterrestrial life could take hold
researcher viorel badescu polytechnic university bucharest romania recently investigated possibility life planet ffps dwarf sbds might contain lake chemical ethane
found life impossible though would significantly different life earth
finding detailed august issue journal planetary space science
failed star dwarf large enough generate nuclear fusion power normal star
failed star slowly radiate internal thermal energy heat dim light hence extremely hard detect
planet dwarf always orbit around parent star found interstellar space
lacking star life ffps sbds would rely body internal heat decay radioactive element energy
one may expect rather stable heat release long period time exceeding two three time present age solar system said badescu
though meager heat could trapped object optically thick atmosphere
life need heat thrive
another important ingredient habitability solvent liquid environment important chemical reaction occur
life earth us water solvent option
synthesis observational data make possible conceive chemical reaction might support life involving compound occurring solvent water badescu wrote paper
particular badescu found ethane compound carbon hydrogen could function well solvent alien life
life without water seems odd consider possibility life object massive jupiter saturn especially since scientist think gas giant planet high radiation hostile atmosphere potential lack planetary surface would harbor life know
badescu said dwarf might lake ocean liquid ethane could prove quite homey alien microbe
main difference water ethane use solvent water polar molecule meaning one end molecule positively charged one end negatively charged
proven integral earth life polar property water enable certain kind molecule dissolve easily water others remain stable
nasa illustration twin brown dwarf orbit
despite name brown dwarf object cool change time therefore definitive color
molecule code life dna rna electrical charge property allow change internal structure specific order base molecule within still overall physical property
enabled way charge property interact polar quality water
would case ethane molecule
dna rna situation small change molecular structure may create large change molecular behavior badescu said
acceptable encoding biopolymer must support darwinian evolution case molecule physical property must remain relatively constant informational content change
however challenge insurmountable completely different type molecule could used code life blueprint ffp sbd
searching life ultimately planet dwarf could prove fertile place look extraterrestrial creature
besides habitable quality body seem quite common universe
dwarf weighing jupiter mass may common star badescu said
total number ffps sbds may exceed number star two order magnitude although planetary embryo ejected planetary system formation type large gaseous atmosphere would retain heat required life badescu said
thus might conceivable ffps sbds common site life universe
