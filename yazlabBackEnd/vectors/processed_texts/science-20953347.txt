genetically modified cow produce human milk
scientist created genetically modified cattle produce human milk bid make cow milk nutritious
scientist successfully introduced human gene dairy cow produce milk property human breast milk
human milk contains high quantity key nutrient help boost immune system baby reduce risk infection
scientist behind research believe milk herd genetically modified cow could provide alternative human breast milk formula milk baby often criticised inferior substitute
hope genetically modified dairy product herd similar cow could sold supermarket
research backing major biotechnology company
work likely inflame opposition gm food
critic technology animal welfare group reacted angrily research questioning safety milk genetically modified animal effect cattle health
professor ning li scientist led research director state key laboratory agrobiotechnology china agricultural university insisted gm milk would safe drink milk ordinary dairy cow
said milk taste stronger normal milk
aim commercialize research area coming three year
milk year maybe time required finally pour enhanced milk consumer cup
china leading way research genetically modified food rule technology relaxed place europe
researcher used cloning technology introduce human gene dna holstein dairy cow genetically modified embryo implanted surrogate cow
writing scientific journal public library science one researcher said able create cow produced milk containing human protein called lysozyme lysozyme antimicrobial protein naturally found large quantity human breast milk
help protect infant bacterial infection early day life
created cow produce another protein human milk called lactoferrin help boost number immune cell baby
third human milk protein called also produced cow
scientist also revealed exhibition china agricultural university boosted milk fat content around per cent also changed level milk solid making closer composition human milk well property
professor li colleague working beijing genprotein biotechnology company said work shown possible humanise cow milk
scientist said produced herd around cow able produce milk
transgenic animal physically identical ordinary cow
writing journal professor li said study describes transgenic cattle whose milk offer similar nutritional benefit human milk
modified bovine milk possible substitute human milk
fulfilled conception humanising bovine milk
speaking sunday telegraph added milk would provide much higher nutritional content
said managed produce three generation gm cow commercial production would need large number cow produced
said human milk contains right proportion protein carbohydrate fat mineral vitamin infant optimal growth development
daily food cow milk provided u basic source nutrition
digestion absorption problem made perfect food human
researcher also insist antimicrobial protein cow milk also good animal helping reduce infection udder
genetically modified food become highly controversial subject currently sold uk europe passed extensive safety testing
consumer response gm food also highly negative resulting many supermarket seeking source product gm free
campaigner claim gm technology pose threat environment gene modified plant get wild plant population weed also believe doubt safety food
scientist insist genetically modified food unlikely pose threat food safety united state consumer eating genetically modified food decade
however two experiment chinese researcher resulted transgenic calf born animal survived ten died shortly birth gastrointestinal disease six died within six month birth
researcher accept cloning technology used genetic modification affect development survival cloned animal although reason well understood
spokesman royal society protection animal said organisation extremely concerned gm cow produced
said offspring cloned animal often suffer health welfare problem would grave concern
need milk giving u already got
helen wallace director biotechnology monitoring group genewatch uk said major concern research genetically modify cow human gene
major welfare issue genetically modified animal get high number still birth
question whether milk cow going safe human really hard tell unless large clinical trial like would drug uncertainty whether could harmful people
ethically issue mass producing animal way
professor keith campbell biologist university nottingham work transgenic animal said genetically modified animal plant going harmful unless deliberately put gene going poisonous
would anyone food
genetically modified food done correctly provide huge benefit consumer term producing better product
